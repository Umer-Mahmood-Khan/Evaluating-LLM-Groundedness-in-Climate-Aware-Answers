General Summary
This report focuses on regional climate trends and their effects on agricultural productivity, with a notable emphasis on cotton cultivation. It discusses key vulnerabilities and highlights strategies being used in cotton zones like Sindh and Punjab.

Temperature
The document projects a national temperature rise of over 2.8Â°C by 2070. Cotton is sensitive to heat stress, particularly during flowering and boll formation. High temperatures decrease yield and degrade fiber quality. Solutions include using heat-tolerant seeds and adjusting planting schedules.

Rainfall
Rainfall patterns are increasingly erratic, causing water shortages at critical cotton growth phases. Irregular monsoons reduce boll development. Drip and furrow irrigation methods are promoted to conserve water.

Humidity
Humidity is not addressed or analyzed for its effect on cotton yield in this document.

Wind Speed
No data or findings are provided regarding wind speed.

Other Factors
Extreme weather events and limited water availability are significant stressors. Integrated pest management and soil moisture conservation are recommended for improving resilience.
