General Summary
This empirical study evaluates the quantitative impact of climate variables on cotton yield in Pakistan. It emphasizes statistical relationships and proposes evidence-based solutions including infrastructure and policy reforms.

Temperature
An optimal temperature of 28.5°C is ideal for cotton; productivity declines above 32°C, with losses reaching 110 kg/ha. Current summer temperatures often exceed 45°C. Suggested measures include better infrastructure and high-temperature-resistant seed varieties.

Rainfall
Flooding from monsoons and glacial melt severely damages cotton fields, particularly in Southern Punjab and Sindh. Constructing dams and improving water storage systems are key mitigation strategies.

Humidity
The role of humidity is not analyzed or supported with data in this report.

Wind Speed
Wind speed is not mentioned in any context.

Other Factors
Fertilizer use increases cotton yield but may indirectly contribute to warming. Land expansion and climate-resilient farming practices are necessary for long-term adaptation.
