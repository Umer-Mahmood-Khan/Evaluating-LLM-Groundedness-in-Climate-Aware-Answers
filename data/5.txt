General Summary
This comprehensive review details the physiological, environmental, and economic effects of climate change on cotton in Pakistan. It discusses specific yield impacts, especially from heat and water stress, and outlines advanced mitigation technologies.

Temperature
Temperature beyond 32°C reduces cotton yield significantly, with a 1°C rise causing a loss of 110 kg/ha. Heatwaves over 45°C impact flowering, boll formation, and root development. Use of transgenic cotton, conservation tillage, and precision irrigation are recommended.

Rainfall
Rainfall variability leads to both floods and droughts. Floods in 2022 alone caused a 41% decline in cotton production. Poor drainage and waterlogging further stress the crop. Adaptations include improved water management and rainwater harvesting.

Humidity
Humidity indirectly affects cotton by fostering pest outbreaks, though it is not quantified or explored in depth.

Wind Speed
There is no discussion of wind speed or its effects.

Other Factors
Pest proliferation due to warmer temperatures and increased pesticide resistance are major challenges. Biotech tools like CRISPR and IPM are recommended, alongside institutional reforms and farmer support programs.
