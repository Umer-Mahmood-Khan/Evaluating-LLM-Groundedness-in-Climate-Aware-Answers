General Summary
This document presents a general overview of how climate change impacts agriculture in Pakistan, including cotton. While the focus is broad, implications for cotton crops are discussed in the context of temperature and water stress.

Temperature
Temperature increase is a major concern, with heat stress leading to increased evapotranspiration and reduced yield. While no cotton-specific values are given, parallels are drawn from cereal crops where a 1Â°C increase reduces yield significantly. Sowing time adjustments and drought-tolerant varieties are being adopted.

Rainfall
Rainfall trends show increased irregularity and reduction in some regions. Monsoon shifts lead to insufficient rainfall during critical crop stages. Farmers are shifting crops and modifying water use practices to cope.

Humidity
Humidity data is not discussed or quantified in this report in relation to cotton.

Wind Speed
Wind speed information is not provided or analyzed.

Other Factors
Climate shocks, including droughts and floods, are becoming more frequent and harmful. Technological innovations and extension services are recommended to build resilience among smallholders.
