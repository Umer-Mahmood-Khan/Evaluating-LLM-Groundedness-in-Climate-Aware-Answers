General Summary
This document outlines risks and adaptive strategies for agriculture under climate change, with specific reference to cotton. It highlights projected climate impacts and emphasizes policy-level responses and climate-smart agriculture.

Temperature
Pakistan’s temperature is expected to rise by 3°C by 2040 and 5–6°C by 2100. Cotton’s sensitivity to heat is acknowledged, with heatwaves affecting boll retention and quality. Adaptation focuses on heat-tolerant varieties, solar-powered irrigation, and adjusted sowing dates.

Rainfall
Less than 250 mm/year rainfall affects over 60% of arable land. Irregular monsoons lead to flooding and droughts during key cotton stages. Improving irrigation infrastructure and better water resource management are emphasized.

Humidity
Humidity levels are not quantified or analyzed in this report in the context of cotton production.

Wind Speed
Wind speed trends or impacts are not mentioned.

Other Factors
Glacial melt and poor water infrastructure reduce water availability. CSA practices including laser leveling, improved seed systems, and agro-met advisory services are proposed as mitigation strategies.
